"""
Various implementations of attention mechanisms for deep learning models.

This module contains multiple implementations of self-attention and multi-head attention
mechanisms, ranging from basic implementations to optimized versions using different
computational approaches. The implementations are primarily inspired by and reference
the code from https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch03.

Classes:
    SelfAttention: Basic scaled dot-product self-attention implementation
    CausalAttention: Self-attention with causal masking for autoregressive models
    MultiHeadAttentionWrapper: Wrapper for single-head attention to create multi-head attention
    MultiHeadAttention: Standard multi-head attention implementation
    MultiHeadAttentionCombinedQKV: Multi-head attention with combined QKV projection
    MultiHeadAttentionEinsum: Multi-head attention using Einstein summation for efficiency
    MultiHeadAttentionScaledDotProduct: Multi-head attention with explicit scaled dot-product
    MultiHeadAttentionPytorch: Multi-head attention using PyTorch's built-in operations
    FlashAttentionScratch: Scratch implementation of Flash Attention for memory efficiency

All implementations support configurable dimensions, number of heads, and attention
parameters, making them suitable for experimentation and educational purposes.

    Flash Attention implementation from scratch for validation purposes.

    This implementation demonstrates the core idea of Flash Attention: computing
    attention in blocks to avoid materializing the full N×N attention matrix,

    queries and keys in blocks and maintains running statistics to compute
    the softmax normalization incrementally.

    Note: This is a simplified implementation. Real Flash Attention uses more
    sophisticated techniques like online softmax and fused kernels.
