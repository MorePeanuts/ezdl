class GPT2Config:
    """
    Configuration container for a GPT-2 style Transformer model.

    Parameters:
        vocab_size (int):
            The number of tokens in the vocabulary. Determines the size of the token embedding matrix.
        context_length (int):
            The maximum sequence length (n_positions) the model can process. Also dictates the size of positional embeddings and the attention mask dimensions.
        embd_dim (int):
            The dimensionality of token embeddings and hidden states (often referred to as n_embd).
        n_head (int):
            The number of attention heads in each Transformer layer. Each head attends to a subset of the embedding dimensions.
        n_layer (int):
            The number of Transformer blocks (layers) stacked in the model.
        n_inner (int | None):
            The hidden size of the feed-forward (MLP) sublayer inside each Transformer block. If None, it defaults to 4 * embd_dim, following the GPT-2 design.
        activation_func (str):
            The activation function used in the MLP sublayer (e.g., 'gelu', 'relu', 'gelu_scratch').
        resid_pdrop (float):
            Dropout probability applied to residual connections and/or outputs of sublayers (attention and MLP).
        embd_pdrop (float):
            Dropout probability applied to token and positional embeddings.
        attn_pdrop (float):
            Dropout probability applied to attention weights (and possibly attention outputs depending on implementation).
        layer_norm_epsilon (float):
            Epsilon value for LayerNorm to improve numerical stability.
        qkv_bias (bool):
            Whether to include learned bias terms in the query, key, and value linear projections of attention.
        use_cache (bool):
            Whether to enable key/value caching for faster autoregressive generation (useful during inference).
        kv_window_size (int): 
            The size of the window for cached keys/values when using a limited or sliding attention cache, controlling how many past tokens are retained for attention. # TODO When implementing dynamic caching, this parameter should be removed. Only used in scratch/gpt2_with_kv_cache_optimized.py now.
